# -------------------------------------------------------------------
#                 CONFIGURATION FOR BACTOMICS WORKFLOW
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- REQUIRED PATHS ---
# !! IMPORTANT !!
# This path should point to your main project folder.
# The workflow will look for your sample folder (e.g., 'isolate1') inside this directory.
# Example: If your reads are in '/home/user/bactomics/isolate1/raw/',
# then base_dir should be '/home/user/bactomics'.
base_dir: /home/user/bactomics

# REMOVED: The 'kraken2_db' path is now managed automatically by the Snakefile.
# You no longer need to set it here.


# --- SAMPLE & RUN PARAMETERS ---

# isolate: The name of the specific sample folder to process.
# NOTE: If using the batch script (./run_batch.sh), this value is 
# automatically overridden for each sample. You can leave it as a placeholder.
isolate: isolate3


# threads: Number of CPU threads to use for parallel tasks.
threads: 12

# --- DECONTAMINATION (KRAKEN2) ---

# target_taxid: The NCBI Taxonomy ID for your specific organism.
# - The workflow uses KrakenTools to KEEP reads matching this ID and its sub-species.
# - All other reads (contamination) are discarded.
# - Set to '' (blank) or 0 to disable filtering (keep all reads).
#
# Finding your ID: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy
# Examples: 
#   400634 (Lysinibacillus fusiformis)
#   1402   (Bacillus genus - safer if you suspect plasmid HGT)
target_taxid: 400634

# run_kraken: Set to true to generate contamination reports.
run_kraken: true


# --- ASSEMBLY & POLISHING ---

# keep_percent: Filtlong quality filter (95 = keep top 95% best reads).
keep_percent: 95

# racon_rounds: Number of Racon polishing iterations (2 is standard).
racon_rounds: 2

# medaka_model: The neural network model for Nanopore polishing.
# !! CRITICAL FOR ACCURACY !!
# - For R9.4.1 Flow Cells (older): Leave as '' (empty). Default model will be used.
# - For R10.4.1 Flow Cells (newer): You MUST specify the model used during basecalling.
#   Example: 'r1041_e82_400bps_sup_g615'
medaka_model: ''


# --- QC & ANNOTATION ---

# busco_lineage: The specific dataset for genome completeness checking.
# Options: bacteria_odb10 (broad), bacillales_odb10 (specific), etc.
busco_lineage: bacteria_odb10
