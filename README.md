> **⚠️ Technical Prerequisites: Intermediate Level**
> This workflow runs in a Linux environment (Ubuntu or WSL). While the bioinformatic steps are automated, **working knowledge of the command line and Conda/Mamba package management is required.**
>
> *Note: Users may occasionally encounter system-specific Conda installation bugs (e.g., dependency conflicts, shell initialization) that are unrelated to the Bactomics code. Troubleshooting these environmental issues requires intermediate technical expertise.*

# Bactomics: The Engineering Genomics Suite

**Bactomics** is a modular bioinformatics platform purpose-built for **geotechnical engineers**, **construction biotechnologists**, and researchers working with **Microbially Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP)**.

Traditional bioinformatics tools focus on biological discovery.  
**Bactomics focuses on engineering verification.**  
It ensures that raw sequencing data produced by external providers meets the **quality, reproducibility, and traceability** required for infrastructure-related biotechnology.

---

## 🎯 Mission Statement

To provide **standardized, engineering-grade pipelines** that allow non-specialists to:

1. **Verify** bacterial isolate identity using genome-wide analysis.  
2. **Confirm** critical metabolic pathways (e.g., urease operon).  
3. **Standardize** QC across bio-cementation projects.  
4. **Ensure reproducibility** across labs and industrial workflows.

# 📦 Bactomics HybAs (HybAs v8.4-lite)

### Targeted Hybrid Assembly & Verification Workflow (Illumina + Nanopore)

**HybAs** is a Snakemake-controlled hybrid assembly workflow that implements **lineage-aware quality control**, ensuring that the genome assembled corresponds to the target taxon identified via 16S rRNA or environmental expectations.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔧 Targeted Assembly
- Uses 16S-based lineage to validate organism identity.
- Enforces taxon-aware QC: Kraken2 contamination filtering, BUSCO lineage-specific completeness.

### 🧬 Hybrid Assembly Engine
- Illumina (accuracy) + Nanopore (structure)
- Assembled using **Unicycler** for gap-free, circular genomes.

### 🔄 Triple Polishing
- **Racon** (ONT polishing)
- **Medaka** (consensus correction)
- **Polypolish** (Illumina error correction)

### 📊 Engineering-Ready Outputs
- MultiQC master report
- Prokka annotation (GFF, FAA, GBK)
- Comprehensive QC summaries

### ⚡ Streamlined (Lite) Architecture
Removes biomedical tools (AMR, plasmids) to focus on **industrial and engineering relevance**.

---

### ✅ Tested Configuration
This workflow was successfully validated on the following system:
* **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (via WSL2)
* **Manager:** Conda 25.9.1
* **Workflow:** Snakemake v9.10.1
* **Language:** Python v3.11.13

# 🛠️ Installation

## 1. Clone Repository
Clone the repository into a folder named `bactomics` to match the default configuration.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/crackberryq/bactomics_hybas.git](https://github.com/crackberryq/bactomics_hybas.git) bactomics
cd bactomics

## 2. Install Snakemake & Mamba

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake mamba
```

---

## 💻 System & Resource Requirements

**1. Internet Access**
* **Required.** The pipeline must be able to connect to:
    * Anaconda Cloud (to install software environments).
    * NCBI/BUSCO servers (to download reference datasets if not pre-cached).

**2. Disk Space (Estimates)**
* **Code & Environments:** ~3 GB
* **Kraken2 Standard Database:** ~60 GB (Critical: Ensure you have space for this!)
* **BUSCO Database:** ~50 MB (Negligible)
* **Project Output:** ~500 MB per bacterial isolate (varies by sequencing depth).

**3. Memory (RAM)**
* **Minimum:** 16 GB (may fail on large genomes).
* **Recommended:** 32 GB - 64 GB.
    * *Note:* Hybrid assembly (Unicycler) and polishing (Medaka) are RAM-intensive.

# ⚙️ Configuration (`config.yaml`)

Example:

```yaml
base_dir: /home/user/bactomics
isolate: isolate3

target_taxid: 400634
threads: 12

keep_percent: 95
racon_rounds: 2
medaka_model: ''

busco_lineage: bacteria_odb10
run_kraken: true
```

---

# 📦 BUSCO Lineage Database (Important)

BUSCO requires lineage datasets such as `bacteria_odb10`, `bacillales_odb10`, etc.  
Set `busco_lineage` according to your **16S identification**.

### Option A — Auto-download (easy)
BUSCO will automatically fetch lineages:
```bash
busco --list-datasets
```

### Option B — Manual Download
```bash
busco --download bacteria_odb10
```

### Option C — Store Lineages Inside Project
```bash
mkdir -p db/busco/
cd db/busco/
wget https://busco-data.ezlab.org/v5/data/lineages/bacteria_odb10.tar.gz
tar -xvf bacteria_odb10.tar.gz
```

Create:
```
db/busco/config.ini
```

Add:
```
[busco]
datasets_dir = /absolute/path/to/db/busco
```

Export:
```bash
export BUSCO_CONFIG_FILE=db/busco/config.ini
```

# 🏃 Running the Pipeline

### Full Pipeline

```bash
snakemake --use-conda --cores 12
```

### Build only final assembly

```bash
snakemake --use-conda --cores 12 isolate3/work/assembly.final.fasta
```

### Regenerate MultiQC report

```bash
snakemake --use-conda --cores 1 isolate3/reports/multiqc/multiqc_report.html
```
> **💡 Pro Tip: Seeing the Details**
> * Use the **`-p`** flag (`--printshellcmds`) to see the exact shell commands being executed.
> * The pipeline uses `tee` to print tool logs to the screen in real-time. If you want it to run silently in the background, remove `-p` and redirect stderr (e.g., `snakemake ... > run.log 2>&1`).

# ❓ Troubleshooting

### BUSCO HTML missing
**Cause:** incorrect lineage (e.g., using "auto").  
**Fix:** match BUSCO dataset to 16S lineage.

### KrakenTools errors
Ensure:
- `db/kraken2_std_db/` is present  
- qc environment contains `extract_kraken_reads.py`

### Polypolish failure
Occurs if BAM is corrupted; delete and rerun mapping.
